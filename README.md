This updated version of rock, paper, scissors builds upon the initial version but rather than having the player enter a value, player clicks on a button for chosen item.
Results and score are displayed on the page via DOM methods rather than console.log.
Winner is declared with 5 wins have been achieved. Game is over and buttons are disabled to prevent further playing.
Player has the option to reset the game by clicking the reset button.  When the reset button is clicked, all scores and results are wiped clean and game restarts.
